Phasor
 - Scripting (integrate into Phasor)
   - Manager (interface with Scripts, call functions etc.)
     - Lua
	 - Python
	 etc

Scripting (or PhasorScript idk):
 - Responsible for integration into Phasor.
 - Handles exceptions thrown by Manager, log them/notify user. 
 - Implements the PhasorAPI and so needs to register functions with Manager.
   - Maybe manage expected types in registration, so API functions are only called if the
     data is of expected type.
 - Responsible for black listing functions that have failed.
   - How to determine which scripts failed? Only Manager can do this atm, maybe send another param?
 - Shouldn't throw exceptions. If a call fails it should return a nil type (after dealing with the error).
 
Manager (ScriptManager):
 - Loads the scripts, manages the loaded scripts.
 - Responsible for calling script functions, converting types from Lua to Scripting.
 - Result / Caller classes
 - Throws exceptions on errors
 
 Lua:
  - As is
