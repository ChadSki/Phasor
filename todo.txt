Make Scripting handle (log) Lua errors.
Add blacklisted functions for when a function fails to execute.
Add function so a script can declare that its return value MUST BE CONSIDERED. If two scripts register
a function, there is a conflict and the latter script won't be loaded. ofc this will be logged.
